Visiting my village recently, I faced a challenge we rarely think about in cities: **no quick way to find contact details for local businesses**. No Google listings, no online directories—just word-of-mouth. It hit me: *What if there was a simple way to connect villagers to the services they need?*  

**Here’s what I did:**  
1️⃣ **The Reality Check**: I assumed limited tech access, but soon realized almost every household had at least one smartphone with internet. The barrier wasn’t tech—it was visibility.  
2️⃣ **Building the Solution**: I created a minimalist web app—*prioritizing simplicity* so anyone could navigate it. After rounds of feedback from locals, the design was finalized.  
3️⃣ **Deployment & Adoption**: Hosted on Vercel, the directory went live! I manually added initial entries with consent, and soon, villagers started requesting to list their businesses.  
4️⃣ **The Ripple Effect**:  
   - 150+ businesses listed (and counting!).  
   - 50+ categories uncovered—**services even locals didn’t know existed**.  
   - Increased visibility for small entrepreneurs, helping them reach new customers.  

Sometimes, the smallest solutions create the biggest impact. Technology isn’t just for cities—it can empower rural communities too.
